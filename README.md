## Description


This is an OpenCore-based Hackintosh EFI. Generally, there's only one thing you need to fix after installing macOS, which you can do yourself. However, I would still recommend that you go through all the documentation guides or video guides to understand it a bit so that you also gain knowledge of Hackintosh. If you don't, then...

Used **AirportItlwm** For Wifi fix And Working Fine

Used **IntelBluetoothFirmware** For Fixing Bluetooth

**All Thing Working Perfectly ‚úåüòÅ**
